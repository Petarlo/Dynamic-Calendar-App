# Dynamic Calendar Application

## Description

The aim of this challenge was build on existing HTML and CSS code and use API's like jQuery and day.js to build a dynamic work day calendar application.

The planner shows todays date at the top of the screen and the timeblock colour changes depending on the time of day (grey for past, red for current and green for future).

Each time block also has a text field that can be saved in local storage.
